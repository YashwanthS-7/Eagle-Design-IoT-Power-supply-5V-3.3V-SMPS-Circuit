# Eagle-Design-IoT-Power-supply-5V-3.3V-SMPS-Circuit
Nowadays, the IoT (Internet of Things) uses various WIFI-based processors like NodeMCU, ESP32, and ESP12E, etc. which operate on 5V or 3.3V. These modules are highly compact and hence to power these boards, it makes sense to use smaller SMPS circuits that can go on the same board, instead of using a separate SMPS circuit.
